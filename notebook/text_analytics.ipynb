    "Customer Information is the backbone for most of the renowned companies in 21st century. Let’s take example of Google. How do you suppose Google is providing so many services for free? What profit does it make by giving you free services? Well it’s your information that google sells to different companies by analyzing your searches and makes profit through it. The moment you search for a product on google, you will start seeing the product recommendation on every website. \n",
    "This is the most basic usage of text analytics, product recommendation to customers by analyzing their searches. Similarly, many companies analyze the positive or negative reviews given by customers and try to predict the customer behavior. \n",

    "## Word Vectorization (Word Embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectorization is the process of mapping words to a set of real numbers or vectors. This is done to process the given words using machine learning techniques and extract relevant information from them such that it can be used in further predicting words. Vectorization is done by comparing a given word to the corpus(collection) of the available words.\n",
    "There are many different methods used for vectorizing a given set of words. let's see some of the mosed popular ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Count Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Count vectorizer uses two of the following models as the base to vectorize the given words on the basis of frequency of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bag of Words Model\n",
    "BOW model is used in NLP to represent the given text/sentence/document as a collection (bag) of words without giving any importance to grammar or the occurrence order of the words. It keeps the account of frequency of the words in the text document, which can be used as features in many models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text1 = “I went to have a cup of coffee but I ended up having lunch with her.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Text2 = “I don’t understand, what is the problem here?”\n",
    "\n",
    "BOW1 = {I :2, went : 1, to : 1,have : 1, a : 1, cup: 1, of :1, coffee : 1, but :1, ended : 1, up :1,having : 1, with :1, her :1}\n",
    "\n",
    "BOW2 = {I : 1, don’t : 1, understand:1, what : 1 , is :1, the : 1, problem : 1, here : 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "BOW is mainly used for feature selection. The above dictionary is converted as a list with only the frequency terms there and on that basis, weights are given to the most occurring terms. But the “stop words” are the most frequent words that appears in raw document. Thus, having a word with high frequency count doesn’t mean that the word is as important. To resolve this problem, “Tf-idf” was introduced. We will discuss about it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### n-gram model\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in bag of words model, BOW model doesn’t keep the sequence of words in a given text, only the frequency of words matters. It doesn’t take into account the context of the given sentence, or care for grammatical rules such as verb is following a proper noun in the given text.n-gram model is used in such cases to keep the context of the given text intact. N-gram is the sequence of n words from a given text/document.\n",
    "\n",
    "When, n= 1, we call it a “unigram”.\n",
    "\n",
    "             n=2, it is called a “bigram”. \n",
    "             \n",
    "             n=3, it is called a “trigram”.\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text1 = “I went to have a cup of coffee but I ended up having lunch with her.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unigram \n",
    "\n",
    "[I, went, to, have, a, cup, of, coffee, but, I, ended, up, having, lunch, with, her]\n",
    "\n",

    "[I went], [went to],[to have],[have a],[a cup],[cup f],[of coffee],[coffee but],[but I],[I ended],[ended up],\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: We can clearly see that BOW model is nothing but n-gram model when n=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip grams are type of n-grams where the words are not necessarily in the same order as are in the given text i.e. some words can be skipped. \n",

    "1-skip 2-grams (we have to make 2-gram while skipping 1 word)\n",

    "Wikipedia definition:  ” Tf-Idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The Tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Tf–idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today.”\n",
