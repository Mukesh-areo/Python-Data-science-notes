    "## 2.1 Anaconda Python Distribution\n",
    "Anaconda is an open-source package manager, environment manager, and distribution of the Python and R programming languages. It is commonly used for large-scale data processing, scientific computing, and predictive analytics, serving data scientists, developers, business analysts, and those working in DevOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda offers a collection of over 720 open-source packages, and is available in both free and paid versions. The Anaconda distribution ships with the conda command-line utility. You can learn more about Anaconda and conda by reading the Anaconda Documentation pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Anaconda?\n",
    "* User level install of the version of python you want\n",
    "* Able to install/update packages completely independent of system libraries or admin privileges\n",
    "* conda tool installs binary packages, rather than requiring compile resources like pip - again, handy if you have limited privileges for installing necessary libraries.\n",
    "* More or less eliminates the headaches of trying to figure out which version/release of package X is compatible with which version/release of package Y, both of which are required for the install of package Z\n",
    "* Comes either in full-meal-deal version, with numpy, scipy, PyQt, spyder IDE, etc. or in minimal / alacarte version (miniconda) where you can install what you want, when you need it\n",
    "* No risk of messing up required system libraries\n"
